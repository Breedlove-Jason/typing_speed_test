# Typing Speed Test

The Typing Speed Test is a simple and interactive application that allows users to measure their typing speed and accuracy. It presents users with a random set of words that they need to type as quickly and accurately as possible. The application calculates the typing speed in words per minute (WPM) and provides real-time feedback on the user's performance.
